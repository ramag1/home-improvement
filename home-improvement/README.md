# Environment setup

Note: 
- Node v8.9.4 and npm v5.6.0 are used for development.

* Mac:
 1. Install Node (https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
 2. On your terminal, `cd` into the `home-improvement` directory
 2. Initialize node modules by running `npm install` in the terminal
 3. Start the server using `npm run start` in the terminal
 4. Open browser and browse to `http://localhost:8080`

* Windows:
 1. Install Node (https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
 2. On your cmd prompt, `cd` into the `home-improvement` directory
 2. Initialize node modules by running `npm install` in the cmd prompt
 3. Start the server using `npm run start` in the cmd prompt
 4. Open browser and browse to `http://localhost:8080`


## Instructions:
 1. First of all, thank you for taking the time to take our coding challenge. We are excited that you are interested in joining Emprove!
 2. You will find data.json in the `src` folder. It contains a list of Design Style, Quality Standard, and Home Area image metadata.
 3. Read the data in data.json.
 4. A mockup is provided in HomeImprovement-Mockup.png. It has the UI and features that need to be implemented.
 5. All images are available in `public/images` folder.

## Libraries:
 1. Please do not use other JS frameworks, such as JQuery, Angular, etc. React is already available for you to use.
 2. Feel free to use CSS frameworks, such as Bootstrap or Material UI. If you choose to use Bootstrap, JQuery is a Bootstrap's dependency. Yes, JQuery is available, but do not use it anywhere in your code.

## Objectives for this coding challenge:
- We would like to see how you structure your code in React and how you code in React.
- We would like to see if you are able to work with json data, create your own responsive design, and follow the mockup to the detail.
- Most importantly, we would like you to have fun doing it!
